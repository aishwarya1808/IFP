# Smart Wearable for Child Tracking and Monitoring

Sexual abuse is one of the greatest threats to the safety and health of Indian children. Child sex abuse (CSA) has been on the rise in the nation.About 10 percent of the urban homeless in the country are children and one in every two urban homeless children is believed to be sexually abused. In the last six months, i.e. between January 1, 2019, and June 30, 2019, 24,212 cases of child abuse have been registered in India, which means 4000 cases in a month, 130 in a day and one in every five minutes. It is highly essential that this problem is addressed at the earliest.

Most of the wearables present today are intended for women who can perceive impending danger and alert their near and dear. There are very few devices for children right now in India and those, only allow parents to track them via GPS.

The wearable intends to use the IoT platform to monitor and track the activities of children. The sensors used in this system are Pulse, Sound detection, GPS and additionally a GSM module for communication. With GPS continually monitoring the location of the child and data coming in from all the sensors, a deduction, of whether the child is in danger, is made. “Safe zones” for the child can be added which are the places that the child frequently visits. Also, a buzzer is provided in the wearable which can be remotely operated by the parent/guardian to alert ant passers-by. 

In this system 3 sensors are integrated namely - pulse detection sensor, sound detection   sensor and GPS tracker which gives better results with more accuracy. The use of GSM as the wireless technology for communication provides a significant advantage. Higher range, reach and quality are all noteworthy attributes of this mode of communication. The sound sensing module detects the presence and absence of sound, thereby giving additional information about the situation the child is facing. GPS tracking proves to be an efficient measure to locate where the event occurred and thereby helps locating the child.
